I run arts & culture nonprofit venues here in Seattle and consult on venue designs/remodels in other cities with my Lonely Buildings project.  Mature, quiet, professional, very active and not home all that often really.  I love good local food and can give you lots of great recommendations for healthy options, and of course the best local coffee and beer.  I (almost) always know where the good concerts and shows are, sometimes free ones too!   I play a lot of volleyball at the beach or park and paddleboard often as well. Maybe I'll take you out on the water if interested! 

Check out my venues by searching ""Fremont Abbey"" or ""Ballard Homestead"" for concert listings.

My housemates and I love sharing the house with people from near or far who have a positive outlook on life and who can respect the space and understand it's a real home not a fancy B&B or hotel. 
  
Though we're not around much, sometimes great conversations do spring up in the evening if the schedules align so that's always fun. Generally it's a pretty quiet house for resting and relaxing. 

Our rooms won't always be available as we typically have long term housemates, but just depends on the time of year and our vacations.

I love to travel and have been so far to Iceland, Copenhagen, Berlin, Haiti, New Zealand, Australia, Honduras, Mexico, Scotland, Ireland, England, Canada, NYC, Austin, California, etc. 

I love hot sauces and fun interesting foods, talking about social change, neuroscience & psychology, etc. 

Paddleboarding and beach volleyball are pretty much my favorite activities these days but hiking, backpacking and sailing are awesome too.

We like to let our guests determine if they want some private personal time while using our space or want the works with sight seeing suggestions and even the option of tagging along with us for some fun.

Uber and Lyft are other quick and easy options for getting around and are usually inexpensive and  expedient at pickups from Eastlake.

I'm a modern calligrapher and home stylist.  I love long walks on the beach, tiny butterflies, chalkboards and headstands.  I hate cooking so much that I once made my husband eat tacos for 30 days straight because it was the only recipe I could stomach.   

If I could live anywhere in the world, it would be Paris.  And I'd give tours of the famous Paris flea markets, eat baguettes without gaining weight, and wear striped shirts whilst riding a bicycle.  I'd have a tiny dog and big hair.  But not a tiny dog WITH big hair, because that would be weird.  But back to reality.  

I really, really love houses and everything related to decorating them.  My favorite holiday is Halloween because it means that I get to sneak a peek inside of beautiful Southern homes (oh, we live in Texas now... did I mention that?).  Anyway, I wanted to make this vacation home truly fabulous, fun and filled with charm.  

Most importantly, I'm a mom of three little girls.  We travel ALOT as a family and I've figured out what makes a vacation go smoothly.

My personal brand is known within several Industries. I have been an independent business person and curator for over 25 years. 

Starting in December, 2013 I became a student and practitioner of the sharing economy, although I've been an active guest here since 2009. 

My approach and concept is simple - sharing four star environments at one star pricing. 

Our schedule is ridiculous but whenever possible I am happy to sit down and talk, occasionally opening a bottle of wine when we do. Mostly, I am on the run throughout the world. Independent and busy people understand me best. Text or call my staff for questions or emergency needs. We are always, always online!

The five things I can't live without?
Good quality coffee
Poetry
Music
Stimulating conversation
My greyhound Rae

My hosting style? 
Flexible. I want my guests to have the experience they are hoping for. If you want a quiet haven, you'll have it. You can be as independent and have as much alone time as you like. But if you want to have coffee with me in the morning, or watch a movie, or walk down to the beach with me and my dog to get some exercise and see the beautiful Puget sound - I like that too.

I used to read and (try to) speak French and German. If you speak either of these feel free to try it out on me, but go slow and be patient!

As a guest?
If I'm travelling for enjoyment, I like getting to meet and interact with my host a little bit. I want the chance to meet new people and discover how they live and what their neighborhoods are like. 
If I'm traveling for business, I will probably want a quiet and organized place to come back to and rejuvenate after a day of hard work.

Do I have a life motto?
I haven't decided on just one yet. But here are two I love:

John Steinbeck:
""A kind of light spread out from her.
And everything changed color.
And the world opened.

And a day was good to awaken to,
And there were no limits to anything,
And the people of the world were good, and handsome.""

We've met many interesting people, the vast majority of whom, I've personally welcomed.  That's one of the best parts of being a host ... meeting the guests and sharing the comforts of the apartment. We tried to create a tranquil environment where guests can relax and feel comfortable.  Our guests often comment that the space is like a home-away-from-home and that they prefer and appreciate the organic experience that can't be found in a hotel.  

I'm the front of the house, and Ralph, my hubby of 27 years, runs the back of the house.  He is masterful at carpentry, electrical, mechanical, and plumbing work, can turn leftovers into dishes worthy of Food & Wine publication, and is as tender as a kitten with our grandkids.  

I'm a quasi-foodie expanding on my culinary skills and choices.  Translation:  I like to eat!  I also enjoy gardening, and our gardens are a constant work in progress. I'm crazy about my family and particularly enjoy hanging out with my daughter and the grandkiddos, who, like their grandfather, have a quick-witted, abnormally twisted sense of humor that keeps me in stiches.

One of my biggest pleasures in life is learning about a new place, new people, new food- both through my own travels and as a host.  My friends would describe me as active, open, engaging, funny and liberal. I was raised in the deep South of the USA (Georgia), the youngest of 5 siblings, but have lived in Seattle for 25+ years. Seattle is a hot bed of music talent, and I take advantage of it by staying updated on emerging talent and attending as many live performances as I can. I am often the oldest person there, but so what! You could not ask for a better city to live in if you are a foodie, as I am.  The variety here is unbelievable. My profession is Interior Design, so of course, design and art are an important part of my life. Books, and more books- don't even try to talk to me if I have a book in my hand!

I have three absolutely gorgeous and brilliant daughters who no longer live with me, which naturally makes them even more attractive! They live in Los Angeles and San Francisco and I visit them often.

My travels have included, but are not restricted to: most of the states within the USA, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Argentina, Cuba, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Morocco, South Africa, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and China. I love hiking, camping, and staying places off the beaten tourist path. I will always choose a host over a hotel- how better to really learn something about the place you bothered to travel?

Once upon a time, I spoke pretty decent Italian, but am rusty and out of practice. I would love some Italian guests to practice with (or rather, ""with whom to practice"", as I will claim to be a grammar expert). My French is even rustier. I have begun to study Spanish recently. I have a great love of the English language and grammar- yes, I was that person in school who loved diagramming sentences, and always had my hand in the air to answer the grammar questions while everyone else's eyes were rolling back in their heads! I am TESOL certified (Teacher of English as a Second Language), and hope to live abroad and teach at some point in my future. In the meantime, I have volunteered to teach English to refugees here in Seattle. Combining hosting and teaching have great appeal to me.

From our front yard and the surrounding blocks you can enjoy views of downtown Seattle and the Olympic Mountains at sunset. From here it's a healthy walk or a super short drive to the many cafes and restaurants that line Rainier Avenue between Hillman City and Columbia City. We are also a short (but steep) walk to Seward Park, one of Seattle's greatest parks boasting a lovely 2.5 mile lakeshore path, swimming beach and 300 acre wild forest to explore.","We have a lively family with two boisterous boys and a dog so you may at times hear some of the day to day noises of children playing, running up the stairs, a bark or two when someone comes to the door.  As far as I can tell, these noises don't seem to transmit too much to the basement apartment, but anyone looking for total peace and quiet may be disturbed. Our quiet hours are 10pm-8am. We are family friendly and have some supplies such as a port-a-crib available upon request.   The apartment will be most comfortable for 4 people, but we can be flexible with additional children, up to a max of 6 people (4 adults max) total.   Please note, there are a number of exterior stairs to navigate, as well as a few interior stairs, which could be a concern for anyone with mobility issues.","We are a healthy walking distance of many great places to visit in the neighborhood: -Hillman City restaurants and businesses: 15 minute walk -Columbia City restaurants and businesses: 20-25 minute walk -Lake Washington/Seward Park: 15 minute walk (includes some steep hills) Or just hop in your car for a short 2-3 minute drive down the road to any of these locations. Cyclists will love this area as we are so close to Lake Washington Blvd, an incredibly scenic road that hugs the lake. In the summers, the city hosts Bicycle Sundays on many weekends between May and September when the street is closed to vehicular traffic. The #7 bus stops on Rainier Ave, 6 blocks away (15 min. walk), about every 10 min., and runs through downtown Seattle.  Pioneer Square is about a 30 min. bus ride.

Highlights include the Broadway Farmers Market, a seasonal fiesta of food, flowers and music; Cal Anderson Park, which is full of dog walkers, Frisbee players and children dipping their toes in the streaming fountain; and the Pike/Pine Corridor's vintage clothing stores, furniture shops and coffeehouses.

We are avid Airbnb guests as well as hosts. We first stayed at an Airbnb location in Sydney, Australia, while honeymooning in January 2012, and were so impressed with our experience that we are now hooked! Not only are the Airbnb properties a good value, but more importantly, we have had amazing interactions with each of the hosts at locations where we've stayed, which now have expanded beyond Sydney, AU, to include a few locations in our home state of Washington as well as cities such as Vancouver, Canada,  Portland and Bend in Oregon, San Francisco and Sonora, CA, Baltimore, Miami, and New York City and Ithaca, NY, and London, Cornwall and Bath in the United Kingdom. We've been a guest in 21 different Airbnb locations over the past 3-1/2 years. In fact, I can't remember the last time we stayed at a conventional hotel!

Since we had such great experiences as guests, we decided to start hosting in the summer of 2012 and listed our guest room on Airbnb. Hosting has proven to be a fantastic experience since we are both seasoned travelers and enjoy chatting with others about their travels, etc.

In terms of demographics, we are both in our mid-forties, have traveled all around the country (and the world) and are also are very tidy and respectful.

I also lived in Washington DC for around 4 years.  This means that I'm an avid Cubs and Bears fan, but love the Washington Capitols, and am becoming a big Seattle Sounders fan as well.  

So, with being from the Midwest, trekking to the East coast, and now living on the far west coast, I have friends and family all across the country.  I travel to see the people whom I miss and care about deeply, as well as continue to see cities and areas in the US, and all over the world as well.

How do I travel and see an area?  Through food and conversation!  I love to experience a new area through the eyes and tastes of those who live in a city. I ask the locals where to get coffee and if they had only one last place to eat at in the city, where they would go.  I adore farmers markets and local shows and (website hidden), good wine, lots of sunlight, and hitting the road with my running shoes are all things I love in life.  I'm looking forward to using Airbnb on many of my future trips.  I've stayed in hotels and many bed and breakfasts on my travels.  But, sometimes I like to hit that farmers market, grab great food and whip up a great meal with wine I've snagged along the way.  Or, if I'm visiting one of my old homes, I want a place where I can ask my family to come over to talk and catch up versus always having to head out on the town.

Favorite places so far I've visited: Ireland - great scotch!  Italy - Way too many amazing qualities to list. Austin - Wonderful live music. DC - history, politics, food, hiking, and again too many to list.

I am a lover, artful life-liver. I love traveling and new experiences. I'm interested in people and their stories. I call the Northwest home, it is a beautiful place that I am grateful to know. 

I took my first international trip at 9 years old, to Mexico with my mother and two of my older sisters, it was magical and lit a spark in me for traveling and experiencing new places and people. At 17 I traveled to Brisbane Australia where I lived for two months. They drank. They were chill. At 21 I headed for Capetown South Africa, where I blessed to spend 3 months studying, traveling and building relationships. The people I met  on this trip are still positively influencing me today. At 26 I sold my car and bought a ticket to Xela, Quetzaltenango Guatemala where I spent one month with some of the most warmly-spirited people you could ever hope to meet. I attended Pop-Wuj, a local language school and community restoration group, and the Trama Textile weaving school/non-profit business, where I was surrounded by gorgeous textiles full of the colors and stories of the various villages in the area. If you ever make it to Xela, I would check out the love-work being done in both of these spaces. 

Traveling the United States became a passion of mine after I road-tripped to Chicago from Seattle with one of my best friends. I was in awe of the land and the skies and felt a renewed sense of this place. I realized that even if I wasn't traveling internationally, I still had opportunities to travel in my home country, and there is just as much to 'know' and see here as anywhere else-AND SO THE ERA OF ROAD TRIPS BEGAN!. My family road tripped up and down the west-coast my entire childhood but the Midwest and South were uncharted territory for me......

There are some other secret spaces and places, that are for me and my memories to hold, places and destinations so special only a wrong-turn and open heart could have made it so :)

I have made the space I live in a home over the past 6 years and appreciate the evolution. I hope to meet you, hear and become a part of your story soon :) Much love, Jen",f,"Queen Anne Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109, United States",Lower Queen Anne,Seattle,WA,98109,47.62632061,-122.357367,t,Apartment,Entire home/apt,2,1,2,2,Real Bed,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",Kitchen,""Elevator in Building"",""Buzzer/Wireless Intercom"",Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",Essentials,Shampoo}",$200.00 ,$100.00 ,$10.00 ,t,27,85,8,8,9,9,9,8

In 2014, I built a backyard cottage (behind the main home) that I rent out to short and long term renters.  I also rent out the main house, a 3 bedroom/2 bath home to long term renters (12 months or longer). My home and cottage are the perfect home-stay for the whole family, including your pooches. 

When I travel, I love staying in Airbnb homes/flats that are walking or biking distances to the local farmers market, pub, or the neighborhood coffee shop.

More about me:
I'm an all season bike commuter (rain or shine) and I currently bike to work via the Burke Gilman bike trail. I'm a member of Warmshowers (a community of traveling cyclists and hosts) where I share my extra bedroom and bathroom (with a full shower & tub) for free to traveling cyclists. One of my guests from Portland wrote: ""Lynda has a beautiful place, and I enjoyed staying there. It's in a quiet neighborhood ""north of the cut"" so it's away from the hustle and bustle of the big city, but also right near the Burke Gilman Trail so it's just an easy ride to all that as well. Though Lynda was on a tight schedule while I was there, she made time for some very pleasant conversation. She also made sure I wanted for nothing. Her home is warm and inviting, the accommodations were very nice, and Lynda was great.""

As a host: Think Singapore airlines first-class, not a Delta red-eye the night before Thanksgiving. I believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect. When you stay at my home, I want you to feel like it's your home. Kick back and relax. If you need a pointer or 2, feel free to ask. I speak French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and am learning Arabic right now. I grew up in a French province and used to bartend so I can probably pick you out a drink if you're in need of libation. I'm also a foodie that both eats out a lot as well as cooks; I can certainly appreciate a judiciously prepared bite and LOVE LOVE LOVE to help people find a satisfying meal. Random jobs I've held the past of note: stunt woman, bouncer, door-to-door sales, microbiologist, human/bovine tissue engineer. Right now, I'm a software architect. My husband also works in software and we have a 1 year daughter who loves to wriggle and play. He speaks Arabic, French and German. She speaks to turtles, pandas and coffee mugs.

As a guest: I've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. I like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). I'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since I've last tried). Ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. I also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. I've never joined a curated tour group and I hope I never do. I've pet tigers in Chiang Mai, bathed with Yakuza in Tokyo, eaten scorpions in Beijing, shot snake vodka in Taipei, swam with jellyfish in Valencia, was marooned in both Paris and Madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of Stuttgart... the list just goes on. My next trip is to the French/Italian Riviera for some serious R&R.

Thank you for reading my profile on airbnb. My name is Kathy and I have lived in Seattle for over twenty five years.  I work in the travel industry.

I can't live without staying connected to my friends, speaking to people from different countries and backgrounds, a daily workout, Trader Joe's, and my family,  which includes my hard working husband my son who works in tech in San Francisco, and daughter who is in the Coast Guard.
We are empty nesters, so we decided to make the lower half of our house an AirBnb.  It was an obvious choice because we travel a lot and we enjoy meeting people from all over the world.  We are new to the AirBnb community.  We have a legal unit with all the permits so instead of just renting the space out, we decided that it would be more fun and exciting be hosts for the new sharing economy.  
As an airbnb host, my number one priority is to make you feel completely at home.  I will be available as much as you want or I will stay out of your way.  The downstairs is completely separate.  You will have your privacy.  Our house is in the Laurelhurst part of Seattle.  It is fitted with everything you could possibly need to have a cozy and warm time, including a gas fireplace with a remote, full bath with heated floors.  The wifi works great.
We have so many glorious memories in this house, we will do whatever we can to make your stay in Seattle great.

I made it as comfortable as possible for you, but it is hard to combat age and for lack of a better word,  basementness. If you are short, on a budget, or used to the youth hostel lifestyle, this may be the place for you. 

I am a professor at the UW, here in Seattle.  In the winter I am a pretty serious about hitting the mountains for skiing and snowboarding.  

When I was eleven years old, I saw Star Wars Episode 4, and I haven't been able to concentrate since then. Even though I am solidly into middle age, I love living in my super hip Seattle neighborhood, and I still go see live music a couple times a month.  

In my twenties and thirties, I would backpack through Europe once or twice a year.  One of the greatest things I ever did was decide to rent an apartment in Prague for a week instead of staying in a hotel or hostel.  I decided to create this little, private, room in my house so that young travelers ( maybe you?) can visit Seattle on a budget. 

I have traveled all over the world, maybe I have visited your town? 

What type of place is this?

Are you looking for an expensive, warm, plush, modern room with great light and tall ceilings?  If so, you should probably move on.  This is a tiny, private room with a private entrance and private bathroom in my basement.  Basements have LOW ceilings, about 6 foot 2 inches, with a low beam that folks taller than 5 foot 9 will need to duck under.  In the winter, basements tend to be cold and damp, there is no way to avoid this. I will provide you with a radiant heater so that you can keep it warm if the ambient heat isn't enough for you.   It has a full size fridge, a coffee pot, a TV, wired and wireless internet, a small bed, a desk, a microwave, a coffee maker, a teapot, a pizza oven.... If you are short, ( ceiling is only 6' tall) if you are a traveler on a budget, if you are used to staying in 2 star European hostels and hotels, and sharing a bath with 20 other people, this place will be perfect for you. 

Basically, this is a Hobbit hole, if you are looking for someplace super nice, move on.  If you are looking for something affordable in an AMAZING NEIGHBORHOOD this may work for you.  

You can walk downtown in 35 mins, 10 mins to Broadway, and 3 mins to grocery stores, bars, and amazing restaurants...

What type of host am I?

You may never even see me.  Once we make arrangements, I will give you the map, the code to the electronic lock, and you can come and go as you please.

It can be adjusted for comfort. CHECKING OUT:  Just leave toe apartment as you found it and report any thing that broke or was not working properly.  That's very helpful.  Leave the key on the kitchen table.  Please don't strip the bed (sheets and pillow cases) pull back the comforter and blanket though; let host know if there is anything that didn't work well or needs attention that could be overlooked by housekeepers; leave the living room light on low when you leave and the key on the kitchen table. USING THE FRENCH PRESS COFFEE MAKER: Background French press coffee is dense and heavy. Though it's sometimes criticized for being chalky, we think that a well-prepared French press is actually quite pure. But be careful: Of all methods, French press is perhaps the most vulnerable to over-extraction. For this reason, it's necessary to transfer the entire contents of your pot to a cup or carafe immediately ","Bus transportation works here. The 5 and the 28 are good choices.

I love to travel.  I look forward to winter snowshoeing, some US travel, hosting on airbnb and a trip to France.  2016 will be my 4th year as an airbnb host.   I speak French and Spanish (much better French) and I have worked in education, real estate, video, and parade art ensemble builds. 

My home is in the ""center of the Universe"" in the artsy and eclectic Fremont area - where you find the Troll under Aurora bridge, a great PCC coop, banks, shops, cafes, and a great night life as well.  

2016 Holiday Season
Holiday events in and around Fremont include the lighting of the Lenin Statue (for real), a parade of caroling boats creating truly heavenly sounds, the Fremont Arts Council Winter Feast on or close to Dec 21, great shopping for unique gifts at all the local shops, First Friday art walk, New Years Eve spectacular fire works on Lake Union, and access to all the Seattle 2016 holiday excitement including the Nutcracker with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Seattle Symphony's New Years Eve Party!  

Summer Solstice
The famous Fremont Solstice Parade happens every June close to summer solstice.  In 2014 I was an Ice Queen Clown and accompanied a 7 foot articulated wolf/dog made from reed and white papier machee created by local artist, Sarah Lovett. In 2015 I was a banner carrier with the lead Samba ensemble group Girasol.  

The Neighborhood
As to the Fremont neighborhood, I moved here years ago thinking I'd stay a couple of years but many lattes, parades  and  3 homes later, I'm still here.  We have a smaller community of artsy, smart and creative people with heart, in the middle of the big city.  I live on a hill and have a partial view of Mt Rainier on a sunny / clear day from one of the rooms and the back deck.  And it's always great to come home to this charming and awesome neighborhood.

FOODIE w/o gluten!!
After years, and maybe more years, I'm pretty much gluten and heavy carb free.  My cooking includes salads, chicken, veggies both raw and cooked, broths and soups, coffee, tea, coconut and chocolate desserts.  Love coconut oil and fresh salmon.
But I taste just about everything and never turn my nose up my guests regional cooking shares.

MORE...
For myself living without the open road, great friends, dream time, and my favorite shoes including some well seasoned ostrich boots from the Boot Lady in Seattle, is not an option.  

AND this year 2016, the cute and lovable 1 bedroom apartment is available for you too.  With a full kitchen and bath, and a great 40"" Vizio flat screen that works with your chrome cast service,  you will love it. If you want extra privacy, your own fridge and cooking space,  and/or room for a couple of friends to travel with you, pick this option.  If you want 100% remodeled please continue your search.  If you love the unique and artistic life, clean, well supplied and situated on a country lane in the city do check out ""Super cool in artsy Fremont""!     

Favorite coffee - Lighthouse Roaster from right up the street at 43rd and Phinney.
Favorite view - from the sun dial at the top of Gas Works Park hill.
Favorite Seattle park - Discovery Park
What I think about Eastern WA - it's an excellent secret - with wide open valleys, rolling hills, rivers, wheat fields and when the rain is over the top in Seattle, there's nearly always SUN!

How I feel about Puget Sound - big love - have to hop a ferry at least a few times a year to visit an Island or the Olympic Penninsula; have to walk on a gravel beach and skip a few rocks to remember the incomparable beauty of the place; seagulls make me (website hidden). Rainier is my sacred mountain - it calls me each year at least once to hike or snowshoe and feel the awesome presence of its magnetic core.

I come from a large family, and I have a large family.  I love them all!  I am a sister to three brothers and two sisters.  I have five children along with their five spouses, who have blessed me with eight grand children.  I guess that means that I identify primarily as a mother and a grandmother.

I am also a Licensed Massage Therapist currently with a small practice in  my home.  

I love to learn about and put into practice natural and healthy food and dietary choices, sustainable living choices, natural healing methods, etc.  

I also love to watch movies, but not so much the big box movies as the smaller independent and foreign films.  I have quite a collection of them.

I attend yoga classes three times a week and find it a very rewarding system of exercise for my body.

I'm married to a wonderful man, Kirk Jolley.  We have been together for about 18 years.  He is a very talented builder and contractor.  He delights in making older homes beautiful again and he is very good at what he does.  

We often travel to Hawaii, since one son lives there with his family.  We also like to go to Mexico and Canada.  I like staying in homes, apartments or condos because I like having my own kitchen or kitchenette.  An unfortunate natural gas exposure has left me with extreme sensitivity to petroleum products, and consequently many scented products and foods.  This requires me to ask about heating and cooking fuels in homes, as well as cleaning products or strongly scented products used therein.

My father was a Scout Master and took us camping a lot.  He taught us to always leave a place cleaner than we found it.  I still do that!  My husband often tells me that I am doing the maids job when I clean up a place before I leave it, but I can't help it...it is ingrained in me.  My kids thought I was a bit of a neat freak, but I've noticed that they learned well, and they all know how to clean and they keep their homes tidy...even the boys.  Needless to say, I would take good care of anyone's place that I stayed in.

My home is in the ""center of the Universe"" in the artsy and eclectic Fremont area - where you find the Troll under Aurora bridge, a great PCC coop, banks, shops, cafes, and a great night life as well.  

2016 Holiday Season
Holiday events in and around Fremont include the lighting of the Lenin Statue (for real), a parade of caroling boats creating truly heavenly sounds, the Fremont Arts Council Winter Feast on or close to Dec 21, great shopping for unique gifts at all the local shops, First Friday art walk, New Years Eve spectacular fire works on Lake Union, and access to all the Seattle 2016 holiday excitement including the Nutcracker with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Seattle Symphony's New Years Eve Party!  

Summer Solstice
The famous Fremont Solstice Parade happens every June close to summer solstice.  In 2014 I was an Ice Queen Clown and accompanied a 7 foot articulated wolf/dog made from reed and white papier machee created by local artist, Sarah Lovett. In 2015 I was a banner carrier with the lead Samba ensemble group Girasol.  

The Neighborhood
As to the Fremont neighborhood, I moved here years ago thinking I'd stay a couple of years but many lattes, parades  and  3 homes later, I'm still here.  We have a smaller community of artsy, smart and creative people with heart, in the middle of the big city.  I live on a hill and have a partial view of Mt Rainier on a sunny / clear day from one of the rooms and the back deck.  And it's always great to come home to this charming and awesome neighborhood.

FOODIE w/o gluten!!
After years, and maybe more years, I'm pretty much gluten and heavy carb free.  My cooking includes salads, chicken, veggies both raw and cooked, broths and soups, coffee, tea, coconut and chocolate desserts.  Love coconut oil and fresh salmon.
But I taste just about everything and never turn my nose up my guests regional cooking shares.

Link to typical tourist sites and some great alternatives: (URL HIDDEN) hidden)/html/travel(phone","AUTUMN/WINTER  The days are getting shorter and the clouds have moved in after a really amazing and sunny summer.  But there's always a lot to do in Seattle.  Be sure to check out hiking sites ((URL HIDDEN) and tour info on line.  At the house there will be information too.  Fremont itself is fun year round and there's a lot to do.  Check out the info guide on this site.  Don't forget the troll, and the huge planet on top of the Saturn Building at 35th And Evanston Ave.  If you are a jogger and train, the steps between Greenwood Ave and 2nd Ave are a good choice when picking a trail around the neighborhood. The markets on Sundays in Fremont and Ballard  are great.  In Fremont there are often Food Trucks and a pizza oven to tempt you as well as lots of cool finds from the region and around the world.  Always ask if you don't find what you want. WINTER SKIING:  Snoqualmie Pass is 45 minutes away and has really popular night skiing.  Alpental offers more challenging runs.  Crystal Mountai","Buses are very convenient and take you downtown in less than 30 minutes.  Check out Seattle Metro for the 5, the 40 and the 28 (bus lines).  There are quite a few bus schedules available so if just ask if you don't see one in your room. A convenient way from the airport is to take the Light Rail train to the University Street station and walk one block north and one block east (up hill) to 3rd and Union where you can catch the 5 bus.  Get out at 43rd and Phinney Avenue by the Lighthouse Roaster.  Then maybe grab a great cup of coffee and call Uber for your quick ride down the hill to the house.   Fremont has a high walk score and the neighborhood has a couple of amazing hills for a good workout. By car you are an hour to Snoqualmie Pass; two hours to Mt Rainier; 20 minutes to the Seattle Public Market (Pike Place Market) which is a favorite; under 3 hours to Portland, 2.5 hours or so to Vancouver BC depending on the border delays, 1 hour over the Narrows (double) Bridge to Gig Harbor, ",https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/17248806/5a4b62eb_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=small&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/17248806/5a4b62eb_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/17248806/5a4b62eb_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/17248806/5a4b62eb_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=x_large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,Ann Petrich,2012-10-19,"Seattle, Washington, United States"," I love art and ""creation."" I love to travel.  I look forward to winter snowshoeing, some US travel, hosting on airbnb and a trip to France.  2016 will be my 4th year as an airbnb host.   I speak French and Spanish (much better French) and I have worked in education, real estate, video, and parade art ensemble builds. 

My home is in the ""center of the Universe"" in the artsy and eclectic Fremont area - where you find the Troll under Aurora bridge, a great PCC coop, banks, shops, cafes, and a great night life as well.  

2016 Holiday Season
Holiday events in and around Fremont include the lighting of the Lenin Statue (for real), a parade of caroling boats creating truly heavenly sounds, the Fremont Arts Council Winter Feast on or close to Dec 21, great shopping for unique gifts at all the local shops, First Friday art walk, New Years Eve spectacular fire works on Lake Union, and access to all the Seattle 2016 holiday excitement including the Nutcracker with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Seattle Symphony's New Years Eve Party!  

Summer Solstice
The famous Fremont Solstice Parade happens every June close to summer solstice.  In 2014 I was an Ice Queen Clown and accompanied a 7 foot articulated wolf/dog made from reed and white papier machee created by local artist, Sarah Lovett. In 2015 I was a banner carrier with the lead Samba ensemble group Girasol.  

The Neighborhood
As to the Fremont neighborhood, I moved here years ago thinking I'd stay a couple of years but many lattes, parades  and  3 homes later, I'm still here.  We have a smaller community of artsy, smart and creative people with heart, in the middle of the big city.  I live on a hill and have a partial view of Mt Rainier on a sunny / clear day from one of the rooms and the back deck.  And it's always great to come home to this charming and awesome neighborhood.

FOODIE w/o gluten!!
After years, and maybe more years, I'm pretty much gluten and heavy carb free.  My cooking includes salads, chicken, veggies both raw and cooked, broths and soups, coffee, tea, coconut and chocolate desserts.  Love coconut oil and fresh salmon.
But I taste just about everything and never turn my nose up my guests regional cooking shares.

MORE...
For myself living without the open road, great friends, dream time, and my favorite shoes including some well seasoned ostrich boots from the Boot Lady in Seattle, is not an option.  

AND this year 2016, the cute and lovable 1 bedroom apartment is available for you too.  With a full kitchen and bath, and a great 40"" Vizio flat screen that works with your chrome cast service,  you will love it. If you want extra privacy, your own fridge and cooking space,  and/or room for a couple of friends to travel with you, pick this option.  If you want 100% remodeled please continue your search.  If you love the unique and artistic life, clean, well supplied and situated on a country lane in the city do check out ""Super cool in artsy Fremont""!     

Favorite coffee - Lighthouse Roaster from right up the street at 43rd and Phinney.
Favorite view - from the sun dial at the top of Gas Works Park hill.
Favorite Seattle park - Discovery Park
What I think about Eastern WA - it's an excellent secret - with wide open valleys, rolling hills, rivers, wheat fields and when the rain is over the top in Seattle, there's nearly always SUN!

How I feel about Puget Sound - big love - have to hop a ferry at least a few times a year to visit an Island or the Olympic Penninsula; have to walk on a gravel beach and skip a few rocks to remember the incomparable beauty of the place; seagulls make me (website hidden). Rainier is my sacred mountain - it calls me each year at least once to hike or snowshoe and feel the awesome presence of its magnetic core.  

I love traveling in France and Europe in general, Mexico, the American West and Southwest, and now, South America.  My favorite way to travel is to friends or family who live there.  Or with a group of like minded people on a small group tour.

We have lived in Seattle for many years. We both came to Seattle in 1979; Charlie from Brooklyn by way of NJ and Sarah from Texas by way of the world. We met in 1983 and were married on 8-8-88.

Charlie has a background in environmental affairs, non-profit leadership and government service. He is also an accomplished amateur photographer. Sarah has a background in art, is a Real Estate agent and manages our properties. 

Our interests are art, music, dance, cooking, gardening and caring for our 3 god-children. 

We bought this house in 2001 and lived in it for 12 years.  We have recently bought a house in the Columbia City neighborhood of Seattle to be closer to our god-children - which made this home available for airbnb. 

We travel often to Mexico, Texas, around the Pacific NW and to the NJ-NY area.  We just celebrated our 25th Anniversary by spending a month in Paris.  While there, we stayed in 4 different apartments and got a real idea of what to do - and what not to do - in order to be the perfect airbnb host.

We have been airbnb hosts for a year and have just been named Superhosts by airbnb. We have a beautiful home, offer great service and are excited to offer our beautiful home to you.

We have lived in Seattle for many years. We both came to Seattle in 1979; Charlie from Brooklyn by way of NJ and Sarah from Texas by way of the world. We met in 1983 and were married on 8-8-88.

Charlie has a background in environmental affairs, non-profit leadership and government service. He is also an accomplished amateur photographer. Sarah has a background in art, is a Real Estate agent and manages our properties. 

Our interests are art, music, dance, cooking, gardening and caring for our 3 god-children. 

We bought this house in 2001 and lived in it for 12 years.  We have recently bought a house in the Columbia City neighborhood of Seattle to be closer to our god-children - which made this home available for airbnb. 

We travel often to Mexico, Texas, around the Pacific NW and to the NJ-NY area.  We just celebrated our 25th Anniversary by spending a month in Paris.  While there, we stayed in 4 different apartments and got a real idea of what to do - and what not to do - in order to be the perfect airbnb host. We will greet you warmly, get you settled, give you tips about the house, the neighborhood and Seattle and then leave you to your own devices.

They are indoor only and prefer to stay at the house, but we can take them with us while you're visiting. If you are interested to co-habitate with them, let us know on the intake form. As noted in the description, we don't have a dishwasher. We also have a decentralized heating system with wall panels in each room, rather than a central heating system. This means you can control the warmth of each area by controlling each unit, which may be different from what guests are used to.","We're centrally located to several bus stops that will take you anywhere you want to go. A parking pass can be provided for street parking. We're about a 30 minute drive from the airport by taxi, or take public transit (the light rail to Westlake, and then a bus to Fremont).",https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/75088108/6be66a01_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=small&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/75088108/6be66a01_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/75088108/6be66a01_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/75088108/6be66a01_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=x_large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,Rachel,2011-11-07,"Seattle, Washington, United States","We are a professional family with 2 high energy daughters and 2 cats.
