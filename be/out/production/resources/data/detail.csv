They've been in love for over forty-four years, are young-at-heart and enjoy hiking and skiing. (They rack up more than 85 days of skiing every season!)

They are delighted to welcome you to the basement apartment in their 1904 home where they've lived for over forty years. 

Ray worked as a graphic artist, magazine publisher, advertising director and restaurant general manager. Nowadays when he's not flying or skiing, he works with wood and steel in his workshop. Eileen worked in the accounting department of a local TV station and loves her daily walks around Seattle, skiing and relaxing with a good book and cup of tea.

You can walk everywhere... for coffee, for groceries, for a night out, for breathtaking views of the Puget Sound.","What's up with the free pillows?  Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases. And if they leave the pillows behind, they'll be donated to a local women's shelter that","Convenient bus stops are just down the block, if you're headed downtown or further afield to explore.

We are young, energetic, adventurous, easy going and polite.  We are excited to be traveling to Europe this summer for the first time and crave to experience all that we can while here.  

We are eager to get to know Europe as the people that live here know it (not like the traditional American tourist does through cruise ships and museums).  We have learned through our travels that the advice of the local resident is always better than a guide book or brocures at a hotel, so we look forward to meeting all the wonderful people on our travels and learning from them.  

Alicia minored in Spanish in college, lived in Salamanca for a summer and speaks well enough to get by, John took some French also and can read for comprehension but does not do well in conversation (hopefully our trip will improve both of our language skills!).  

We enjoy trying all sorts of new food and wine and are very adventurous in that area.  We like to go out in the evenings, have a few drinks and maybe do some dancing.  We are also perfectly happy staying in and having a glass of wine on the patio while the sun sets.  

John is a great cook and Alicia is great at cleaning, tidying up and great with kids as she is a nanny in the States. We have no problem pitching in and helping out with dinner or the chores when the time calls.  

I hope this helps shed some light on who we are, though we know that we can't tell everything in this little description.  We have many hobbies and interests and hope to pick up more on our travels, if you are curious or would like to know more about us, Please Please ask us, we are more than willing to share!

As a host: Think Singapore airlines first-class, not a Delta red-eye the night before Thanksgiving. I believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect. When you stay at my home, I want you to feel like it's your home. Kick back and relax. If you need a pointer or 2, feel free to ask. I speak French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and am learning Arabic right now. I grew up in a French province and used to bartend so I can probably pick you out a drink if you're in need of libation. I'm also a foodie that both eats out a lot as well as cooks; I can certainly appreciate a judiciously prepared bite and LOVE LOVE LOVE to help people find a satisfying meal. Random jobs I've held the past of note: stunt woman, bouncer, door-to-door sales, microbiologist, human/bovine tissue engineer. Right now, I'm a software architect. My husband also works in software and we have a 1 year daughter who loves to wriggle and play. He speaks Arabic, French and German. She speaks to turtles, pandas and coffee mugs.

As a guest: I've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. I like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). I'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since I've last tried). Ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. I also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. I've never joined a curated tour group and I hope I never do. I've pet tigers in Chiang Mai, bathed with Yakuza in Tokyo, eaten scorpions in Beijing, shot snake vodka in Taipei, swam with jellyfish in Valencia, was marooned in both Paris and Madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of Stuttgart... the list just goes on. My next trip is to the French/Italian Riviera for some serious R&R.

We live on a quiet sweet street where I know all my wonderful neighbors, but it's a perfect central Ballard location where you can walk to almost anything. We're 3 blocks from a few fabulous restaurants and bars (Brimmer and Heeltap, Veraci Pizza, Slate Coffee, and the El Camion taco truck), 3 blocks from two grocery stores (Ballard Market and Safeway), and 3 blocks from two different parks with playgrounds and grassy space to run around. Check out my Guidebook for more details. A 15-25 min walk will get you to almost everything else, including the Zoo, the public pool, the library, Trader Joes, the Ballard Farmers Market, and a ton of restaurants/bars/shops in downtown Ballard. A 10 min drive straight east takes you to the University of Washington campus (UW), or drive 10 min south to Seattle Pacific University (SPU).","The neighbor does have a few dogs that sometimes bark a little (and sometimes don't at all).

Our favorite way to get around when not walking or driving is calling a Lyft or Uber through their phone app. Pick up is very quick here. It only costs about $5 to take a Lyft/Uber to downtown Ballard from our house, and you can always decide to stroll home later if you feel like a walk after dinner.

Ballard used to be a small town independent of Seattle, so it offers all the entertainment and amenities of a city in one neighborhood! Micro-brews, restaurants, coffee shops and boutiques. It even has a jazz club with music almost every night of the week.  On Sundays downtown Ballard transforms into a Farmers Market with local food and products being peddled.   My favorite Ballard attraction is the Ballard Locks. From June to October you can watch the great salmon migration at the locks as they jump the fish ladder. Year round you can watch the boats move through the ship canal as they head out into the Sound. The Locks host various cultural events in their botanical garden during the summer, such as music and tours. Events are free to the public.","We have a small, cuddly dog named Giacomo.

We are a newly married couple with a healthy curiosity for travel and culture. For our honeymoon we backpacked around the world in 10 unforgettable months. We came back to the states to attend Graduate School at the UW and put down roots here in gorgeous Seattle. I, Yedida, am originally from Portland, OR and Vincent is from Eastern WA, so we know the Pacific NW like the back of our hand. 

We enjoy cooking, being outdoors, exercising, reading and dancing (well, that's just me!). Travel remains our number one love. I remain loosely connected to the international community through my work as an Italian instructor. 

We are very open people who are used to travel, meeting new people and sharing community space. During our honeymoon we utilized both (website hidden) and WWOOF (World Wide Organization of Organic Farming) to gain a deeper perspective of the countries we were visiting. Nevertheless, we absolutely respect privacy and the need for quiet or alone time. We will be happy to let you do your own thing if that's your preference, but we will be equally happy to share the communal spaces in our home. 

We have a roommate, Kevin, who occupies the basement floor of the house. Kevin is an accomplished pastry chef and works a lot in the summer. You will catch him in the kitchen cooking up all sorts of yummy treats for us!

Alan and his brother have owned the house for 5 years and Katence is a 3rd generation Seattlelite and Ballardite. We've themed our humble abode after the neighborhood with a manual including all our favorite hang outs, eats, and sites to see. 

We love living in the great city of Seattle, and all it has to offer, as much as traveling around the world.  Alan's travelled all over the Western hemisphere and around Asia, and have been lucky enough to be paired with a girlfriend, Katence, who has the traveling cliff-notes and the next destination in mind.

Our last vacation was to Belize and Southern Guatemala with a scuba run-in with 40ft whale sharks.  Looking forward to the next adventure, or kicking back with a delicious glass of wine (currently Kerloo Cellars Columbia Valley Syrah; quite nice).

Our last trip was one to remember, volunteering with Katence's organization, GIVE Volunteers, helping to release a school to a remote community in Nicaragua.

The district's name derives from the architectural style, typical of so many of the early houses in this area. The historic mansions are home to many of Seattle's economic and cultural elite.   In 1962, Lower Queen Anne became the site of the Century 21 Exposition, a World's Fair. The fairgrounds are now the campus of Seattle Center, home to the Space Needle, Pacific Science Center, EMP Museum, the north terminal of the Seattle Center monorail, and KeyArena, where the Seattle Storm plays. Newest to the Seattle Center campus is Chihuly Glass and Garden. Opened in Spring 2012 at",Walking distance to: -Seattle Center -Space Needle -Gates Foundation -Chihuly Gardens -Children's museum -Pacific Science center -Key Arena,,Jeff,2011-08-04,"Berkeley, California, United States","I studied Neuroscience and Psychology at UC Berkeley and went on to found Merlock L.L.C

My dream is to use the profits of our labor to start a non-profit company that will help disadvantaged people around the world, afford medical care. Specifically a program that will send doctors from the US to the third world, to train mid-level healthcare workers to effectively treat the sick.

I love the houses, my neighbors, and the short walk to anything one could need - grocery store, drugstore, hardware store (very important to an old house owner), a wonderful array of restaurants from Afghani to Thai. It's also a really good neighborhood for walks, as the houses around here are quite well taken care of, and many of them have lovely gardens.  If you like pet-patting as I do, there are a lot of dog owners walking their pets throughout the day, and I have found them to be quite generous in sharing the affection of their dogs.

The Good Shepherd Center, home to many non-profit organizations,  is also home to Seattle Tilth, an organic gardening organization.  Tilth has a P-Patch (community gardening plots) and a Community Learning Garden with self-guided tour on site.","Please note that the house is a work in progress!

If you are expecting a completed work of art of a house, well, we're not there yet:  windows need trim, some walls need paint, the stairs inside the house are still construction treads (very strong and functional, just ugly), the tub surround needs tile.

I run arts & culture nonprofit venues here in Seattle and consult on venue designs/remodels in other cities with my Lonely Buildings project.  Mature, quiet, professional, very active and not home all that often really.  I love good local food and can give you lots of great recommendations for healthy options, and of course the best local coffee and beer.  I (almost) always know where the good concerts and shows are, sometimes free ones too!   I play a lot of volleyball at the beach or park and paddleboard often as well. Maybe I'll take you out on the water if interested! 

Check out my venues by searching ""Fremont Abbey"" or ""Ballard Homestead"" for concert listings.

My housemates and I love sharing the house with people from near or far who have a positive outlook on life and who can respect the space and understand it's a real home not a fancy B&B or hotel. 
  
Though we're not around much, sometimes great conversations do spring up in the evening if the schedules align so that's always fun. Generally it's a pretty quiet house for resting and relaxing. 

Our rooms won't always be available as we typically have long term housemates, but just depends on the time of year and our vacations.

I love to travel and have been so far to Iceland, Copenhagen, Berlin, Haiti, New Zealand, Australia, Honduras, Mexico, Scotland, Ireland, England, Canada, NYC, Austin, California, etc. 

I love hot sauces and fun interesting foods, talking about social change, neuroscience & psychology, etc. 

Paddleboarding and beach volleyball are pretty much my favorite activities these days but hiking, backpacking and sailing are awesome too. 

cheers,

I run arts & culture nonprofit venues here in Seattle and consult on venue designs/remodels in other cities with my Lonely Buildings project.  Mature, quiet, professional, very active and not home all that often really.  I love good local food and can give you lots of great recommendations for healthy options, and of course the best local coffee and beer.  I (almost) always know where the good concerts and shows are, sometimes free ones too!   I play a lot of volleyball at the beach or park and paddleboard often as well. Maybe I'll take you out on the water if interested! 

Check out my venues by searching ""Fremont Abbey"" or ""Ballard Homestead"" for concert listings.

My housemates and I love sharing the house with people from near or far who have a positive outlook on life and who can respect the space and understand it's a real home not a fancy B&B or hotel. 
  
Though we're not around much, sometimes great conversations do spring up in the evening if the schedules align so that's always fun. Generally it's a pretty quiet house for resting and relaxing. 

Our rooms won't always be available as we typically have long term housemates, but just depends on the time of year and our vacations.

I love to travel and have been so far to Iceland, Copenhagen, Berlin, Haiti, New Zealand, Australia, Honduras, Mexico, Scotland, Ireland, England, Canada, NYC, Austin, California, etc. 

I love hot sauces and fun interesting foods, talking about social change, neuroscience & psychology, etc. 

Paddleboarding and beach volleyball are pretty much my favorite activities these days but hiking, backpacking and sailing are awesome too. 

cheers,

First of all, your hosts Barbara and Michael have been residents of Seattle since 1980 and Queen Anne residents since 1985.  We are semi-retired, having originally worked in the travel industry. Your co-host Max is fully retired.   •WE LOVE QUEEN ANNE.  We live on the north-side of Upper Queen Hill (one of the seven hills surrounding downtown) - two blocks from Seattle Pacific University (SPU), facing Fremont and the Ship Canal.   •WHY QUEEN ANNE? - When you could choose from so many other neighborhoods including staying right in the middle of downtown.    THREE MAJOR POINTS TO CONSIDER  ONE - Queen Anne is one of the closest neighborhoods to downtown as well as to the Space Needle and Seattle Center, a major cultural center and sightseeing area.  TWO - Queen Anne has some of the most incredible view points in the city due to being located on a hill.  THREE - although you are in a major city, it does not have a hectic, busy city feeling.","MINIMUM RENTAL – 2 days •ADDITIONAL PERSON (Living Room) - $25 per day PRICE INCLUDES: •Self-serve coffee and teas.

Seattle, Washington, USA                   Member since October 2013.

Thanks for checking us out for your visit to Seattle. We would like to be your local hosts while you are here.

Barbara is a native of Austria and speaks German as well as English.  Michael is from Miami and speaks Spanish, Portuguese and some Italian.  We both had careers in the travel industry and were able to travel, study, live and work in many places around the world. In 1980, we chose Seattle as our favorite place to live, especially on Queen Anne. 

Now that we are both retired from the full time working world we have found many interesting and pleasurable activities, in addition to hosting of course that fill our time. 

These include cooking (inspired by Barbara's time as a personal chef), in-city and in-nature walking, spending quality time with our family and friends, being active grandparents, appreciating Seattle's world class arts scene (especially opera, ballet, theater & gallery arts) just to name a few. 

We are both very interested in the study of herbs and essential oils (aroma therapy). In addition, Barbara continues on as a licensed yoga therapist and teaches yoga.

Michael is involved in the growing ""movement for health"" scene. He is also developing a series of books for children (and the child in all of us) around the theme of giraffes.

Last but not least is Sammy, our 5 year old beagle. He is friendly and adorable. He helps both of us to be in the moment and connected to the outdoors as we walk through the different neighborhoods on Queen Anne. And he

We don't have a bathtub, our eating space is over carpet, and nothing is kid proofed. We don't have kids, so we have no kid accessories.

So we do welcome children and infants, and they do count as additional guests in our rate calculations. To Fee or Not to Fee: We used to charge a cleaning fee for each stay.

My name is Tiffany.  I'm originally from the Bay Area (near San Francisco) in California, and I just moved to Seattle a few months ago.  I'm absolutely in love with the Northwest, but I'm also super passionate about traveling (especially solo traveling!).  I spent a few weeks backpacking in Europe by myself: not only did I see some gorgeous sights, I met a lot of incredible people on my trip.  I really miss traveling while working a full-time job, and I'm hoping to meet fellow travelers through Airbnb to make up for it.  My style of traveling is more local- instead of seeing all the possible tourist destinations, I like to spend a good amount of my time somewhere experiencing life as a local would live it!

While I live it here and have everything I need (and you will need), it's not like living in a house - doors are smaller, toilets are funny, entry onto the boat can be awkward, and sometimes the boat rocks.  What else that is good to know before you come - the ceiling height is not standard, max 7', plus there are a few smaller accesses to different parts of the house.

There is an excellent organic bakery and coffee shop, several French restaurants, a sushi joint, and a pizza place.  There is a small quickie-mart type convenience store as well. Going south 8 blocks will get you to ""Little Ethiopia"" with an abundance of Ethiopian restaurants (which we love).

There is a nice, and somewhat secret, beach on Lake Washington about a 20 minute walk from our place, which is a great place to swim in the summer.  A short bus ride (or uphill walk) will get you up to Capitol Hill, where you'll find loads of restaurants, bars, music venues, and shopping. Just a little further is Downtown with even more amenities.","Please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more enjoyable or if you need more info. We're happy to talk.

Recently, though, now that I'm retired from my teaching position, Eric and I have started splitting our time between the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest.

I love traveling, watching foreign films, enjoying all types of cuisine, and doing all sorts of sports (tennis, biking, hiking, cross-country skiing). 

A few of my favorite travel destinations are France, Mexico, Peru, New Zealand, Morocco, and Turkey.  

As I have spent my life traveling and living abroad (Oaxaca, Strasbourg, Barcelona,  Bodrum, & Djerba) and visiting friends here and there, I'm a low-key guest who's always interested in getting to know others, and adapting to various ways of life.  In the role of host, I am there for you and ready to help, but I'll always allow you complete privacy.

I can't live without Eric, my family, my book group, cats, my iPhone, a tennis racket, fennel, avocados, or sunshine.
